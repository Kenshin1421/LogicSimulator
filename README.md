# About
A simple logic gate simulator to test out different circuits with the ability of saving and designing your own custom logic gates.

# To Run
Clone the repo and if you have Microsoft Visual studio , run the .sln file. Otherwise i dont know , will upload compiled binaries one day.

# Controls
I - Input Node <br />
O - Output Node <br />
R - Reset space <br />
S - Save current circuit as a logic gate (No fail safe , make sure there is a name , input nodes and output nodes) <br />
Left click - Turn input nodes on and off , place gates. <br />
Right click - Right click on nodes to make wires. <br />
Mid Click - Mid click anywhere on the play area to make a middle node. <br /> <br />
**Only Made as a fun project so no way to delete aldready made custom gates (You will have to delete the gate directly from SavedGates folder) , or edit your circuit (Only way is to reset the space).
